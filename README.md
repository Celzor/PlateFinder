# Plate Number Lookup

Simple UI to lookup where a Western Australian license plate is from.

There are multiple sources for WA plate data, and this project aims to consolidate them into a single source, with a simple UI to search them.

## Data Format

There are several types of plate, from the most generic only giving us a rough year, to the more specific that can tell us the exact shire or council area.

- general plates
  `1 ABC 123`

- special plates
e.g. "IT" - "TC" - "TAXI" - "CT" etc. (some of these clash with others...)

- Organisations and Charities

- Town and Shire Councils
